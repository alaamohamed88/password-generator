#Password Generator

password-generator is a Python-based password generator that creates strong, random passwords with customizable length and a balanced character composition. It ensures security by distributing the password's characters into 30% uppercase letters, 30% lowercase letters, 20% digits, and 20% special characters. This generator can handle both short and long password lengths, starting from a minimum of 8 characters.

Features

    - Customizable Length: User-defined password length (minimum 8 characters).
    - Secure Composition: Ensures the password has a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
    - Randomized Output: Uses Pythonâ€™s random module to generate highly random passwords.
    - Handles Large Passwords: Efficiently handles lengths greater than the available characters in any category (e.g., password length of 100+).

How It Works

    - The user is prompted to input the desired password length.
    - The script validates the input to ensure it is a number and that the length is at least 8.
    - The password is generated by distributing characters based on pre-defined percentages:
        - 30% uppercase
        - 30% lowercase
        - 20% digits
        - 20% special characters
    - The characters are selected randomly and shuffled to maximize randomness.
    - The password is output as a string for the user to copy and use.
